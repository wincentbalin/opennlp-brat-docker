# Docker setup of brat annotator and OpenNLP framework
[OpenNLP framework](https://opennlp.apache.org/) contains
the connector to the [brat annotator](http://brat.nlplab.org/).
This [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) recipe 
connects the two and enables a quick setup of an OpenNLP+brat
annotation environment.
